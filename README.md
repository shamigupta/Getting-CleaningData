# Getting & Cleaning Data
Course Project Repository

The R script called run_analysis.R does the following. 
    - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    - Creates an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
